# NYC-Bike-Trip-Analysis
# Overview of the Project
This analysis is performed using a data visualization software called, Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike sharing company. I have obatined NYC City bike data externally and performed analysis to present to the investor of Des Moines. 

## Purpose
In order to solidify the proposol to the investor, I  have performed the visualization of the bike trip analysis that covers the following:
1. How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
2. How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
3. A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

# Results
1. Check out time by users - Demonstartes the lenght of time that bkes are checked out for all riders. The analysis shows that most of the users checked out between 0 to 20 minutes.

2. Check out time by gender -  Demonstartes the lenght of time that bkes are checked out for all riders by gender. The analysis shows that the highest number of users were male and the lowest were in the "UNKOWN" category.

3. Trip by weekday - For this analysis I have created a heatmap to present the number of bike trips by weekday. Per the analysis, the bikes on an average were checked in around 8am throughout the week and picked up again during the evening.

5. Users trips by Gender by Weekday - For this analysis I have created a heatmap to present the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each Usertype.

# Future Analysis
6. Check out time by Age and Gender - The analysis is performed using a cluster map to present the numbers of users broken down by age and gender.
